AI-Based Grading Insights - A Human-Centered Academic Performance Dashboard
Abstract:
AI-Based Grading Insights is a web-based dashboard designed to empower educators and
students with meaningful, interactive, and AI-generated insights into academic
performance. The system emphasizes human-computer interaction (HCI) principles to
ensure the interface is accessible, intuitive, and responsive. With visual analytics, smart
predictions, and fairness evaluation, the tool bridges data and action for educational
improvement.
Problem Statement:
Instructors and students often deal with raw grade data without intuitive tools to extract
patterns or gain actionable feedback. Existing systems either lack visual appeal or are too
technical for non-experts. Furthermore, identifying at-risk students, unfair grading patterns,
or performance trends is time-consuming. There is a need for a smart, user-friendly
interface that simplifies analysis and decision-making in education.
Objectives:
- Design an HCI-friendly dashboard to display academic data clearly.
- Integrate AI to provide intelligent grading insights.
- Improve accessibility and interactivity in performance analysis.
- Facilitate early intervention for at-risk students.
- Ensure fairness and transparency in grading systems.
System Architecture:
Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for UI.
Backend: Node.js / Express or Flask for APIs and logic.
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for grade and user data.
AI/ML: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, OpenAI API).
Hosting: Frontend (Vercel/Netlify), Backend (Render/Heroku).
Key Features:
- Role-based dashboards for teachers and students.
- CSV/Excel grade upload with schema preview.
- Interactive charts for trends and distribution.
- AI-generated insights, warnings, and study tips.
- Grading fairness analysis and bias detection.
- Custom alert settings for teachers.
User Interface Design:
The interface prioritizes clarity and interaction. Main components include:
- Login/Signup with Role Selector
- Dashboard (KPI strip, Trends, Insights)
- Upload Page (with table preview)
- Settings Page (Theme, Language, Notifications)
Design principles applied: simplicity, feedback, accessibility, and affordance.
